# MoonBoard 2016 Route Recommender & Generator (WIP)

A personalized training companion for the MoonBoard 2016 setup â€” combining machine learning, custom route filtering, and future Bluetooth LED integration.

---

## Project Overview

This project has grown into a full-stack app that helps climbers:

- Find problems that match their preferred holds and difficulty
- Use ML to recommend routes based on real MoonBoard data
- (Coming soon) Generate entirely new climbs based on learned patterns
- Build an intuitive interface for mobile or web interaction
- (Planned) Control the MoonBoard LEDs via Bluetooth

---

##  Machine Learning Highlights

- Cleaned and structured 1,200+ MoonBoard problems from JSON
- Extracted start, middle, and end holds to build per-route vectors
- Created one-hot encoded binary matrices for route representation
- Built a cosine similarityâ€“based recommender system to return top 5 routes based on user-selected holds and grade
- Enabled grade filtering and style-aware problem matching

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and open the main Jupyter notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daami30330/MoonBoardRecommender.git
cd MoonBoardRecommender


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open moonboard_analysis.ipynb to explore the dataset and test the recommender.
